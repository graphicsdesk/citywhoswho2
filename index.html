            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Four West Harlem leaders have announced their candidacy in the most competitive race the 70th Assembly district has seen since Inez Dickens succeeded Keith Wright in 2017.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  District 70 includes Manhattanville, West Harlem, and Central Harlem, spanning from West 110th Street to West 145th Street. The district encompasses Columbia’s Manhattanville campus, City College of New York, Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Park, and a part of Riverside Park.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The declared candidates—Maria Ordoñez, CC ’23, Shana Harmongoff, Joshua Clennon, and Jordan Wright, the son of Keith Wright—are vying for the contested seat previously held by Dickens. Ordoñez was the first to announce her campaign for the office and Jordan Wright, who announced his candidacy on Feb. 24, was the last to join the race.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  All candidates in the District 70 race said that they are participating or planning to participate in the New York State Public Campaign Finance Program, a new initiative in which the state matches small donations—between $5 and $250—made by district residents to local political campaigns. The primaries will be held on June 25.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Spectator spoke with each candidate about their motivations for running, the issues they plan to address, and their goals for the election season.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ordoñez, a tenants rights organizer, activist, and lifelong Harlem resident, was the first to announce her campaign in September. In 2021, while she was a student at Columbia, Ordoñez was the youngest of 13 candidates who ran for New York City Council in District 7. Ordoñez lost to Abreu, CC ’14, who currently holds the position. In 2022, she served as a committee member of the 70th district of the state assembly.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In an interview with Spectator, Ordoñez said her motivations for running for state assembly in District 70 are rooted in watching leaders neglect Harlem and feeling the need for a progressive movement. Ordoñez described her campaign “as the only progressive campaign in this race.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We have history of leadership that has literally forgotten Harlem, either through the negative impacts that come out of gentrification, displacement, or because we’ve forgot the community, and we’re not really paying attention about what the needs are for this community and growing up here, I’ve seen that firsthand,” Ordoñez said. “This is why I’m running—because we need change, and together, I think that with a progressive movement, we can make that happen in Harlem.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Heading into the campaign season, Ordoñez listed affordable housing, accessible healthcare, and improving education as her platform’s priorities.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ordoñez wants to focus on “keeping people in Harlem, in Harlem” by catering to the diverse housing population in Harlem, including those living in co-ops, Housing Development Fund Corporations, public housing, small homes, and rent stabilized apartments. She also hopes to implement accessible healthcare for everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ordoñez also said that funding quality education is a campaign priority—particularly highlighting the need to invest in the City University of New York system.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “CUNYs need to be free,” Ordoñez said. “We have City College, that’s an amazing institution in this district, and it’s underused. We need to be making that more of a place where students can feel like they can go to college. They’re gonna go to City College, and they’re gonna get an education there.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ordoñez attended Columbia Secondary School for middle and high school, after which she graduated from Columbia College in 2023 with a degree in political science. Even though Ordoñez says she had a “wonderful experience” at Columbia, she also noted that being born and raised in West Harlem, she had also felt the impacts of Columbia’s expansion.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When asked about how she hopes to navigate the community’s relationship with Columbia, Ordoñez said she hopes to better keep the University accountable for its responsibilities under its West Harlem Community Benefits Agreement.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We have a community benefits agreement, we need to have more oversight of that community benefits agreement and see what has been done and what hasn’t been done,” Ordoñez said. “I want to use my position to really pressure Columbia and ensure that we are keeping up with that community benefits agreement.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ordoñez also noted the impacts of the University’s expansion on her own neighborhood. She said she saw many neighbors evicted from her building over health concerns, and many small businesses move out because of Columbia’s expansion.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  However, Ordoñez said that asking Columbia to stop expanding “is not going to happen,” and that she believes open dialogue between West Harlem residents and Columbia is the best way to hold Columbia accountable.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think that’s the most important way to look at this—hold Columbia accountable and really have those as community roundtables, community forums and bring stakeholders from the community, and the community to these meetings to ensure that there’s actual attendance to these meetings,” Ordoñez said. “I completely understand that we need to be doing more.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ordoñez said that with her experience as a state committee member, she is confident that she can win a similar campaign.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I bring in my lived experiences and my experience as a state committee member, and it’s a place where we’ve already won,” Ordoñez said. “I am a state committee member, we know that we can win, and we’re gonna do it again.”
</p>

</div>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Clennon, an affordable housing advocate, political organizer, and fourth generation Harlem resident, was the second candidate to announce his campaign in September.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In an interview with Spectator, Clennon said that losing his father to gun violence at a young age motivated him to give back to his community through public service and ultimately led him to run for the District 70 assembly seat. A graduate of Frederick Douglass Academy, Clennon attended Pennsylvania State University before returning to Harlem.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I’ve been engaged in public service for over 10 years now,” Clennon said. “Whether it’s serving on the community board or organizing youth events to curb gun violence. Professionally, I’ve been working in affordable housing, managing low-income housing cooperatives, to maintain affordability in our community.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Clennon’s campaign priorities include affordable housing, public safety, and economic mobility. He said that his Harlem roots and hands-on advocacy experience are unique assets to his campaign.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I’m the only independent candidate who’s running for the community and by the community,” Clennon said. “I’m the only candidate who has actual professional hands-on experience working in affordable housing, which, you know, I think all Harlemites would agree is the number one pressing issue for our community.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Clennon said he hopes to focus on policies aimed at further investment in income-targeted housing and the creation of more homeownership opportunities.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I want to create more low-income homeownership opportunities by utilizing city-owned land and also acquiring more buildings from people that are looking to sell, and converting rent-stabilized buildings into housing cooperatives, so that we give working class people within the community the opportunity to own their apartment, so they can control their destiny and become stakeholders in the community,” Clennon said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When asked about his perspective on Columbia’s relationship to the community, Clennon said that he feels that many people in District 70 do not view Columbia as part of the community, and that he hopes to create a stronger, mutually beneficial partnership with the institution.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Columbia is the largest landowner in our city, and we need to make sure that the land that Columbia is utilizing has a tangible benefit to the residents of our community,” Clennon said. “Whether it’s subsidized community space that’s open to the public, whether it’s affordable housing that’s accessible to the public, or other uses or educational programming and uses that our community can benefit from.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Over the next several months, Clennon hopes to engage with voters through petitioning and meet-and-greet events. He emphasized his commitment to addressing the issues that Harlem residents care most about.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Our campaign slogan is ‘Harlem for the many, not the few,’ and that’s just a testament to our dedication to ensure that all members of our community, regardless of their origin, background, have the opportunities and resources that they need to thrive here,” Clennon said.
</p>

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Harmongoff, who was born and raised in Harlem, announced her campaign in December. Harmongoff studied marketing at South Carolina State University before pursuing a Juris master’s and a Juris doctorate from the Appalachian School of Law.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  After her studies, she worked as a property manager for seven years before returning to Harlem in 2016 to work with State Senator Brian Benjamin, where she oversaw pandemic relief efforts. During her time as director of community affairs, she had the chance to speak to community members about their needs which cemented her “love for Harlem.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I have always had a community service background from my parents,” Harmongoff said in an interview with Spectator. “So having a background of civic engagement, growing up as a kid, motivated me to go to law school and to basically legislate for the community.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Harmongoff ran for State Senate in District 30 in 2022 and acquired 29 percent of the votes in the Democratic primary beforing losing to Cordell Clear, who still holds the position.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Harmongoff’s priorities are improving mental health care, affordable housing, advocating for seniors, supporting small businesses, and helping the people experiencing homelessness.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We need more mental health resources,” Harmongoff said. “Everything affects your mental health, so I definitely want to join or be the chairperson of mental health.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  With affordable housing, Harmongoff said she’s “really big on wanting to have a block-by-block area median income,” where the median income is reported by block to create more affordable housing opportunities in the neighborhood. She also said she wants to help further legislation regarding turning vacant spaces into housing.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There’s a lot of vacant buildings that could be furnished or places like warehouses,” Harmongoff said. “There’s not a vacant warehouse that can’t be transformed into apartment buildings for the homeless. So that’s something that gotta be legislated too.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When asked about Harlem’s relationship with Columbia, Harmongoff said moving forward, she hopes to use more of Columbia’s resources to hold town halls and seminars, especially to mobilize young voters.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We’ve seen a lot of young people not voting,” Harmongoff said. “A lot of students don’t even know who is the elected official for the area. So I definitely want to be present and keep the communication open with the students and as well as the University with the community.”
</p>

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Wright, the last candidate to join the race, announced his campaign on Feb. 24. A Harlem resident of 29 years, Wright served as the campaign manager of Yusef Salaam’s City Council District 9 run and now works as Salaam’s chief of staff. In an interview with Spectator, Wright said he is running because of his love for the community and his ability to provide a fresh perspective in Albany.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Wright cited the knowledge he has gained working alongside Salaam as a strength of his platform.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The City Council district is largely aligned with the Assembly district,” Wright said. “So I think it’s important that a lot of the problems are pretty analogous, and I was able to see it with a unique lens having grown up in the neighborhood my entire life.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Wright said that affordable housing is the top priority of his campaign.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I plan on working tirelessly on negotiations upon getting to Albany … for the development of affordable housing, you know, battling to right the wrong of ever, ever, ever letting 421-a expire without a solid replacement,” Wright said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Wright said he also hopes to prioritize education, mental health, and employment.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Our young people are the future, and I think that it’s important that they’re taken care of. And on top of that, I just think generally, the mental health in Harlem is a big struggle,” Wright said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Wright said that he sees mental health as connected to the unemployment crisis and that he also hopes to focus on the creation of new jobs.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think that if people in Harlem have a job, have somewhere to go and something to do, then I think that goes to the new developments that are coming up in Harlem,” Wright said. “I think folks who I see every day need to be a part of building them.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When asked about Columbia’s relationship to District 70, Wright said he understands that the University is deeply connected to the community, especially having attended Columbia Secondary School for eighth grade.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Columbia needs to be in the interest of sharing good land with the neighborhood,” Wright said. “I think that there can be a really beautiful … combination between Columbia and the residents of Harlem. I think that everyone should be working together to make sure that gets done in the right way.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the months leading up to the June election, Wright said he hopes to meet as many residents as possible.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I’m really hopeful to meet a lot of the people in the neighborhood who I’ve met on the campaign trail, originally with Yusef, and on the campaign trail I’ve truthfully kind of been on my entire life,” Wright said.
